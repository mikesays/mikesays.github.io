_Craptacular On-Call_

### Meaning

It was a perfect storm where nearly everything that could possibly go wrong, did go wrong. In the proffered example, this included monitoring failures, human response to monitoring, cloud service provider failures, failures of engaging the cloud service provider, multiple hangs, application configuration issues, and ultimately a full database restore that may or may not have been needed in hindsight.

### Etymology

The term craptacular comes from an episode of The Simpsons, where Bart Simpson refers to poor-quality Christmas Lights that Homer bought as 'craptacular'. It's not surprising that Mike looks up to Bart Simpson. It is surprising that he uses phrases learned from Bart Simpson on retrospective calls of 3-hour long production outages that include members of at least three different teams including the applicaiton owners..

Do I really have to add 'craptacular' to my spell checker now?

### Example

_"Yesterday's issue was a craptacular on-call."_
